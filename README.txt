To run the Encoder-Decoder model, download the steady state data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KBQAjNUeEm7JcbpA7uK18aAsL7nDr75P/view?usp=sharing. 
Put the data in the same directory as the symmetrical_ae.py and run the script.

To run the UNET model, uncompress UNET.7z, mode the data into that folder, and run the train.py script inside.
To run the Resnet-18 model, uncompress ResNet.zip, mode the data into that folder, and run the train.py script inside.
